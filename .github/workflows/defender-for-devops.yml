# Microsoft Security DevOps (MSDO) is a command line application which integrates static analysis tools into the development cycle.
# MSDO installs, configures and runs the latest versions of static analysis tools
# (including, but not limited to, SDL/security and compliance tools).
#
# The Microsoft Security DevOps action is currently in beta and runs on the windows-latest queue,
# as well as Windows self hosted agents. ubuntu-latest support coming soon.
#
# For more information about the action , check out https://github.com/microsoft/security-devops-action
#
# Please note this workflow do not integrate your GitHub Org with Microsoft Defender For DevOps. You have to create an integration
# and provide permission before this can report data back to azure.
